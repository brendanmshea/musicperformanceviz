This visualization tries to answer questions about Boston area music performances, such
as:
<ul>
<li>Are performances of certain music genres more common in some neighborhoods than others?</li>
<li>For a given time period, where can I find folk performances for less than $20?</li>
</ul>
The target audience is people who are interested in local music performances, and fans
of music and live music performances in general.
<br/>
We chose these motivating questions as they are of interest to both of us, in addition to being
generally interesting to others.
<br/>

<h3>Use</h3>
The visualization has two main parts:
<ul>
	<li>The view (on the top) shows either the Graph view of the data, or the Map view of the data, depending
on which is selected.</li>
	<li>The filters (on the bottom) allow you to filter data by time, price, genre and neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
By changing the filters, the data shown in the view will change to match.  You can therefore 'drill down' into
a subset of the data that is of interest.
<br/>
<br/>
The Graph view shows the data in an abstract representation -- location is encoded by position (the events are
grouped by neighborhood), price is encoded by size, and genre is encoded by color.  Clicking on the event will
show more detailed data about the event, including a link to the artist's allmusic.com page, if one exists.
<br/>
<br/>
The Map view shows the same data, but now displayed on a map.  Location is of course encoded by position, and genre
is encoded by color.  Similar to the Graph view, clicking on the event shows more detailed data.
<h3>Data</h3>
There are two primary sources of data that we used:
<ul>
	<li>www.boston.com- this is where we got all of the music events from, plus a bunch of supporting data</li> 
	<li>www.allmusic.com - we used this to round out genre information, as well as get links</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insights</h3>
Fill this in.
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
Beyond general cleanup of the data quality (for instance, the 'Unknown' genre),
it would be nice to have some richer mapping capabilities, like the ability to get directions
from an address to an event.  Also, the time and price filters could show a 'histogram' of data as their 'legend', allowing
the user to get a sense of the density of data across the range without even looking at the view.
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Overall this was an enjoyable project to work on -- in addition to creating a cool visualization, we got to play
with a new technology, namely Adobe Flex.  There were some challenges getting reasonable data to visualize, but
we were able to successfully clean it to the point where we can draw some conclusions, and have a useful tool.
